Note: Date interpretation may vary. Ed-Fi recommends inclusive dates, but states may define dates as inclusive or exclusive. For calculations, align with local guidelines. |

**continuationOfServicesReasonDescriptor** | **String** | The \"continuation of services\" provision found in Section 1304(e) of the statute provides that (1) a child who ceases to be a migratory child during a school term shall be eligible for services until the end of such term; (2) a child who is no longer a migratory child may continue to receive services for one additional school year, but only if comparable services are not available through other programs; and (3) secondary school students who were eligible for services in secondary school may continue to be served through credit accrual programs until graduation. Only students who received services at any time during their 36 month eligibility period may continue to receive services (not necessarily the same service). | [optional]

**endDate** | [**DateTime**](DateTime.md) | The month, day, and year on which the student exited the program or stopped receiving services.  Note: Date interpretation may vary.
