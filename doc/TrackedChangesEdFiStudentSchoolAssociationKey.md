**entryDate** | [**DateTime**](DateTime.md) | The month, day, and year on which an individual enters and begins to receive instructional services in a school for each school year.

Ed-Fi recommends inclusive dates, but states may define dates as inclusive or exclusive. For calculations, align with local guidelines. | [optional]
